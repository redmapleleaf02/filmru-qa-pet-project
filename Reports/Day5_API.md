## Summary:

- Tester: Yeldos Zhetesuly;
- Project: film.ru exploratory testing;
- Scope: API testing.

## Activities:

- Designed **7 test cases**.

## Test Cases Executed:
- TC-API-001;
- TC-API-002;
- TC-API-003;
- TC-API-004;
- TC-API-005;
- TC-API-006;
- TC-API-007.

## Status:
- Checklist partially completed;
- All 7 test cases drafted and executed;
- API testing scope covered only at a basic level due to CMS limitations.

## Notes:
1. During the API testing it was identified that the website “film.ru” is based on a CMS platform. Requests are processed via HTML/AJAX rather than a REST API. Therefore, API testing was limited to verifying HTTP status codes and analyzing response bodies for consistency with UI behavior.
