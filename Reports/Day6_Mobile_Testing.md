## Notes:
1. The website’s search system on a mobile device shows the same issue as on desktop, which allows easy reference to Bug Report #4. (The problem is that the parameters “By date” and “Alphabetical” do not work);
2. In addition to the parameters not functioning, the mobile search does not include the same parameters as on desktop, namely: “All pages”, “Movies”, “Movies online”, “People”, “Publications”, “News”, and “Games”. Only “By relevance”, “By date”, and “Alphabetical” are available;
3. The same spelling error as indicated in Bug Report #9 (“Удалить эккаунт” -> “Удалить аккаунт”);
4. There are no password strength indicators, and it is possible to set extremely weak passwords. This refers back to Bug Report #10.
