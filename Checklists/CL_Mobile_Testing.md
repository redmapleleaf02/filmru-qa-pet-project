# filmru – Checklist. Mobile Testing (Android 13. Chrome)

## 1. Display and Responsiveness:
- The site opens correctly in a mobile browser (Chrome);
- No unwanted horizontal scrolling (except for sections where it is provided by the design. For example, carousels, galleries, sliders);
- Fonts are readable, buttons and links are not too small;
- Images scale properly and are not cut off;
- Navigation menu adapts (burger menu works).

## 2. Functionality:
- Registration and login work on a mobile device;
- Search is available and displays results correctly;
- Comments can be posted/read without errors;
- Video/media content plays and does not break the layout.

## 3. UI/UX
- Buttons and input fields are easy to tap with a finger (not too small);
- Forms open and close correctly;
- No overlapping elements (e.g., button covering text);
- Colors and contrast allow text to be easily read on a small screen.
